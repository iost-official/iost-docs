Currently, IOST smart contracts programming depends on [go-iost](https://github.com/iost-official/go-iost).

In the future, IOST will become independent of go-iost.

Developers needs to clone the entire branch:

```git
git clone https://github.com/iost-official/go-iost.git
```

Then, install `node` and `npm` in the directory `go-iost/iwallet/contract`.

## Installing ```Node```

Please refer to [Official Documents](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download/package-manager/#macos)

## Installing```npm```

```git
cd go-iost/iwallet/contract
npm install
```
