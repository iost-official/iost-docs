This page shows detailed information of configuration.
You can get the latest config as below:

- genesis.tgz: https://developers.iost.io/docs/assets/testnet/latest/genesis.tgz
- iserver.yml: https://developers.iost.io/docs/assets/testnet/latest/iserver.yml

We are going to step through each section in [default configuration](https://github.com/iost-official/go-iost/tree/master/config).

## Config iServer

- acc

```
acc:
  id: producer000
  seckey: 1rANSfcRzr4HkhbUFZ7L1Zp69JZZHiDDq5v7dNSbbEqeU4jxy3fszV4HGiaLQEyqVpS1dKT9g7zCVRxBVzuiUzB
  algorithm: ed25519
```

When iServer becomes a producer, it signs the block with the privkey `acc.seckey`.   
`acc.id` is the IOST account bind to that producer.
However this field is not used actually.

- genesis

```
genesis: config/genesis
```

Since [Everest v2.3.0](https://github.com/iost-official/go-iost/releases/tag/everest-v2.2.0), iServer reads genesis info from a directory instead of a single config file.   
Such directory contains essential system contract as well as the genesis config file.   
See also [config genesis](#config-genesis)

- vm & db

```
vm:
  jspath: vm/v8vm/v8/libjs/
  loglevel: ""
db:
  ldbpath: storage/
```

Settins of v8vm and database.

- snapshot

```
snapshot:
  enable: false
  filepath: storage/snapshot.tar.gz
```

If enabled, iServer will start from a snapshot of the blockchain instead of nothing.   
You can easily catch up the current height using a snapshot.

- p2p

```
p2p:
  listenaddr: 0.0.0.0:30000
  seednodes:
  chainid: 1024
  version: 1
  datapath: p2p/
  inboundConn: 15
  outboundConn: 15
  blackPID:
  blackIP:
  adminPort: 30005
```

listenaddr is the address that the p2p network listens on. If the node is deployed on a cloud service, be sure to open the port in the security group.  
seednodes are seed nodes discovered by the p2p network and can be populated with any known list of nodes.  
chainid is used to isolate different networks.  
version is the network protocol version number.  
datapath is the storage directory of the p2p routing table, node private key and other data.  
inboundConn is the maximum number of connections that are connected.  
outboundConn is the maximum connected connection.  
blackPID and blackIP are the node ID and node IP of the blacklist. With the configuration, the node rejects the p2p network connection of the blacklist node.  
adminPort is the network management port and can only be accessed through localhost.

- rpc

```
rpc:
  enable: true
  gatewayaddr: 0.0.0.0:30001
  grpcaddr: 0.0.0.0:30002
  trytx: false
  allowOrigins:
    - "*"
```

enable indicates whether to enable the RPC service.  
gatewayaddr is the listening address of JSON RPC.  
grpcaddr is the GRPC listening address.  
trytx indicates whether the transaction is pre-executed.  
allowOrigins is a cross-domain setting.  

- log

```
log:
  filelog:
    path: logs/
    level: info
    enable: true
  consolelog:
    level: info
    enable: true
  asyncwrite: true
  enablecontractlog: true
```

There are both console and file handlers for logging.
It's recommended to leave this block default.

- metrics

```
metrics:
  pushAddr:
  username:
  password:
  enable: false
  id: iost-testnet:visitor00
```

We are using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect realtime data, or [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) particularly.   
[HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is supported.   
Check [this](4-running-iost-node/Metrics.md) to set up your own Prometheus server.

- version

```
version:
  netname: "debugnet"
  protocolversion: "1.0"
```

Description of the node information.

## Config Genesis

Change of genesis will prevent iServer from connecting to the IOST network.   
Make sure you know what you are doing.

- tokeninfo

```
tokeninfo:
  foundationaccount: foundation
  iosttotalsupply: 90000000000
  iostdecimal: 8
```

`iosttotalsupply` defines the maximum amount of IOST.
It does not mean those amount of IOST is going to be created at genesis stage.

- witnessinfo

```
witnessinfo:
  - id: producer000
    owner: 6sNQa7PV2SFzqCBtQUcQYJGGoU7XaB6R4xuCQVXNZe6b
    active: 6sNQa7PV2SFzqCBtQUcQYJGGoU7XaB6R4xuCQVXNZe6b
    signatureblock: 6sNQa7PV2SFzqCBtQUcQYJGGoU7XaB6R4xuCQVXNZe6b
    balance: 0
```

Witnesses are the producers on top of the genesis.   
Producer will alternates with new come Servi nodes.

- admininfo & foundationinfo

```
admininfo:
  id: admin
  owner: Gcv8c2tH8qZrUYnKdEEdTtASsxivic2834MQW6mgxqto 
  active: Gcv8c2tH8qZrUYnKdEEdTtASsxivic2834MQW6mgxqto
  balance: 21000000000
foundationinfo:
  id: foundation
  owner: Gcv8c2tH8qZrUYnKdEEdTtASsxivic2834MQW6mgxqto
  active: Gcv8c2tH8qZrUYnKdEEdTtASsxivic2834MQW6mgxqto
  balance: 0
```

This section defines admin and foundation account.

### initialtimestamp

```
nitialtimestamp: "2018-11-10T11:04:05Z"
```

It is the start time of the network.
