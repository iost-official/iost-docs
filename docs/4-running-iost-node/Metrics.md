Metrics is a tool that monitors system performance. We use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for our system.

## Deploying Prometheus

If you are running an IOST node, and would like to look up the metrics of the node, follow these steps:

* Run prometheus `pushgateway`

```
docker run -d -p 9091:9091 prom/pushgateway
```

After installation, go to `[pushgateway_ip]:9091` in your browser and you can see the following page (`[pushgateway]` is the IP the docker is deployed to):

![example](../assets/doc004/pushgateway.png)

* Run prometheus server

```
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

* Configure `promethus.yml`

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'codelab-monitor'
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    target_groups:
      - targets: ['pushgateway_ip:9090']
```

Remember to replace `pushgateway_ip` with the docker's IP address.

![example](../assets/doc004/prometheus.png)

* Configure `iserver.yml`

```
metrics:
	pushAddr: "pushgateway_ip:9090"
	username: ""
	password: ""
	enable: true
	id: "defined_by_yourself"
```

Add the above configuaration to `iserver.yml`.

After the above steps, you can check IOST metrics in "prometheus\_ip:9091". The following metrics are provided:

```
iost_pob_verify_block: Number of verify blocks
iost_pob_confirmed_length: Block height
iost_tx_received_count: Number of transactions received
iost_txpool_size: Number of transactions to pack
iost_p2p_neighbor_count: Number of neighbors
iost_p2p_bytes_out: Bytes sent
iost_p2p_packet_out: Packets sent
iost_p2p_bytes_in: Bytes received
iost_p2p_packet_in: Packets received
```

## Metrics permission validation

If you need to add permission to metrics to avoid others pushing metrics to your system, deploy an nginx instance and add permission control. Refer to the document for specific steps: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/basic-auth/

After nginx deployment, add a `username` and a `password` field to the `iserver.yml` configuration file.
